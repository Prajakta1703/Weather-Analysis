# Weather-Analysis
Analyzed and visualized weather data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to identify trends in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. Performed data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations to derive meaningful insights on weather patterns.

Key Highlights:

1.Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed weather datasets for accurate analysis.

2.Performed statistical analysis using Pandas and NumPy to compute mean, median, min, max, and correlations.

3.Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and variations in temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

4.Visualized weather patterns through line plots, histograms, scatter plot and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5.Derived insights on seasonal trends, hottest and coldest days, and variable relationships.

6.Summarized findings to support data-driven understanding of climatic behavior and decision-making.
